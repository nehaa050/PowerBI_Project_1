# Supermarket Sales Semantic Model Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the semantic model developed in Power BI for a fictional Mexican supermarket chain. The goal of the model is to unify in‑store and online transaction data with product hierarchy details (categories, subcategories, individual products) to analyze profitability across channels and merchandise dimensions in an easily accessible academic style.

## Business Context and Analytical Questions

The supermarket chain operates both physical stores and an e‑commerce platform. Executives and category managers need to understand:

1. **Which sales channels** (physical vs. online) deliver the highest profit margins.
2. **Which product categories** and subcategories most contribute to overall profitability.
3. **How individual products** perform in terms of revenue, cost, and margin.

**Case of Study:** A recent promotional campaign increased online orders but the chain observed unexpected dips in category margins. The leadership team commissioned an analysis to:

* Compare profitability by channel before and after the campaign.
* Identify subcategories where margins declined.
* Propose adjustments to pricing and assortment strategies.

## Data Sources and Tables

All source definitions are documented in **"Data Dictionary.xlsx"**. The semantic model integrates the following tables:

| Table Name              | Description                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calendar**            | Date dimension (year, quarter, month, day, fiscal week)                                |
| **Channels**            | Sales channels (Physical, Online)                                                      |
| **Products**            | Product master (ID, name, subcategory, category)                                       |
| **Categories**          | Product category definitions                                                           |
| **Subcategories**       | Product subcategory classifications                                                    |
| **Sales\_Transactions** | Fact table of all sales: transaction ID, date, channel, product, quantity, price, cost |
| **Returns**             | Fact table of returned items: date, channel, product, quantity, refund amount          |
| **Costs**               | Cost data by product and period                                                        |

## Semantic Relationships

To enable cross‑filtering and time analysis, the model defines:

* **Calendar\[Date] → Sales\_Transactions\[Date]** and **Returns\[Date]**
* **Products\[ProductID] → Sales\_Transactions\[ProductID]**, **Returns\[ProductID]**, **Costs\[ProductID]**
* **Channels\[ChannelID] → Sales\_Transactions\[ChannelID]**, **Returns\[ChannelID]**
* **Subcategories\[SubcategoryID] → Products\[SubcategoryID]**
* **Categories\[CategoryID] → Subcategories\[CategoryID]**

This star schema allows any slicer on date, channel, category, or product to flow through all measures.

## Key Measures and Calculations

The following measures (DAX expressions) were created to capture profitability and performance:

| Measure Name                | Definition & Purpose                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Sales**             | `SUM(Sales_Transactions[Price] * Sales_Transactions[Quantity])` — aggregate revenue                |
| **Total Cost**              | `SUM(Costs[UnitCost] * Sales_Transactions[Quantity])` — aggregate cost of goods sold               |
| **Gross Profit**            | `Total Sales - Total Cost` — absolute profit                                                       |
| **Profit Margin (%)**       | `DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Total Sales])` — profit as a percentage of sales                          |
| **Sales by Channel**        | `CALCULATE([Total Sales], Channels[ChannelName] = "Online")` (and similarly for Physical)          |
| **Margin by Category**      | Applies the **Profit Margin** measure over each product category                                   |
| **Return Rate**             | `DIVIDE(SUM(Returns[Quantity]), SUM(Sales_Transactions[Quantity]))` — percentage of items returned |
| **Net Sales After Returns** | `Total Sales - SUM(Returns[RefundAmount])` — net revenue after refunds                             |

*All DAX expressions are detailed in the Data Dictionary under the "Expression" column.*

## Analytical Scenario & Solution

**Situation:** After promoting a “Buy‑One‑Get‑One‑Free” offer online, the chain saw a surge in orders but thinner margins. Managers posed these questions:

1. How did the promotion impact online vs. in‑store profitability?
2. Which subcategories experienced the largest margin declines?
3. What corrective actions in pricing or cost structure could restore targeted margins?

**Approach & Outcome:**

1. **Benchmark pre‑promotion metrics**: Calculated baseline **Profit Margin** by channel and category for the period before the campaign.
2. **Compare promotion window**: Used time‑intelligence measures to compare the promotion period against the baseline.
3. **Identify hotspots**: Mapped margin change by subcategory, revealing that high‑volume snacks saw a 4% drop.
4. **Propose solutions**: Recommended adjusting promotional depth on affected subcategories and renegotiating supplier costs.

As a result, leadership gained a clear view of margin erosion drivers and implemented targeted pricing adjustments.
